In developing and continuously maintaining MedDRA, ICH endeavours to provide a single standardised international medical terminology which can be used for regulatory communication and evaluation of data pertaining to medicinal products for human use. As a result, MedDRA is designed for use in the registration, documentation and safety monitoring of medicinal products through all phases of the development cycle (i.e., from clinical trials to post-marketing surveillance). Furthermore, MedDRA supports ICH electronic communication within the ICH’s Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) and the E2B Individual Case Safety Report.
